## Project Overview
This project explores the integration of object-oriented programming and design principles in creating a robust Camp Management application. The report outlines our methodology, highlights key test cases, and reflects our learning process throughout the development journey. Join us as we navigate building an Object-Oriented Application for effective camp management.

## Features
- Seamless camp reservation for customers
- Detailed class diagrams for efficient implementation
- Scalable and maintainable software solution

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Design Tool:** Visual Paradigm

## Methodology
We followed object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to design and develop the camp management software. The use of Visual Paradigm helped us create detailed class diagrams, ensuring a clear understanding of class relationships and efficient implementation of OOP principles.

## Key Test Cases
We highlighted and tested key scenarios to ensure the robustness and reliability of the application. These test cases are documented in the project report.

## Learning Process
Throughout the development journey, we reflected on our learning process, focusing on improving our skills in designing scalable and maintainable software solutions.
